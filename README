AVR module: Timer
============================================================================

A submodule used in other projects. Currently cmake is used to build a library
of the module. The path structure within the project should be as follows.
The includes are looked for in the subdirectory "config" and "util" at the same
level as the adc module.

Environment:
------------

<some project path>
:
|
+- config
|  |
|  +- timer_config.h
|
+- timer
|  |
|  +- <submodule sources>
:

Use the following git commands to get the submodule:

# to get the submodule
git submodule add git@github.com:mkleemann/timer.git <path/to/adc/module>
# commit the submodule to your repository
git commit

# update your submodule, when needs be
git submodule update

To use the submodule, you may make use of the cmake-avr toolchain. The
project has to define the include search path at the parent directory
of the module.

Have fun!
